    "## The problem of PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "We often obtain high-dimensional data sets, in which each observation has many dimensions. In the parlance of practitioners of machine learning, each multidimensional observation is called a **sample** and each dimension is called a **feature**. We will use the observation/dimension and sample/feature nomenclature interchangeably. Considering the Palmer's penguin data set, each observation (sample) is a penguin, and the dimensions (features) are bill depth, bill length, flipper length, and body mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The features, though many, may be related. We can imagine that there are unobservable variables, called **latent variables** at play the influence many features. For example, consider the four features of the penguin. They could all scale with the caloric intake of the penguins, in which case the latent variable of caloric intake could use used to predict all four of the features; it is responsible for most of the variation in what is observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now formalize this. Let $\\mathbf{y}\\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ be a set of observable features. There are $D$ of them. In the case of the penguins, $D = 4$. Let $\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^L$ be the set of latent variables that influence the observations. Typically, $L < D$ and often $L \\ll D$, and, as such, if we can infer the latent variable $\\mathbf{z}$, we say we have achieved **dimensionality reduction**. Specifically, we define a model for $\\mathbf{y}$, $\\mathbf{y} = h(\\mathbf{z};\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is some set of parameters. So, to achieve dimensionality reduction, we want to find a function $h(\\mathbf{z};\\theta)$ that most faithfully reproduces the observed $\\mathbf{y}$.\n"
